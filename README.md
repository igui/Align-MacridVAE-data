# BPR/VBPR Implementation and Demo
In this repo you will find my implementation of BPR and VBPR (paper for BPR: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1205/1205.2618.pdf, paper for VBPR: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.01784.pdf). See the Jupyter notebook for the demo.

## Setup
To fully run this, you will need to have Python 3.8 installed along with all packages listed in requirements.txt.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will also need to download the GloVe 840B token Common Crawl word vector dataset, unzip it, and put it in the "/data" folder.
